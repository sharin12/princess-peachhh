		Oh, you could be my little Princess Peach
	And I could be your Super Mario
	The two of us were always meant to be
	I know I never shoulda let you go
	I've been waiting for a lifetime
	You've been waiting for the right time
	If I had an extra life
	I swear I would die for you twice
	I turn off the power and take out the game
	Blow on the cartridge and try it again
	No matter what, it turns out the same
	You're up in a castle, I'm down in the drain
	You're on a whole other level of love
	I'm stuck at the bottom, you're way up above
	So many enemies in between us
	But you know I'll never give up
	Oh, you could be my little Princess Peach
	And I could be your Super Mario
	The two of us were always meant to be
	I know I never shoulda let you go
	And now you're almost always out of reach
	I can't take the distance in between you and me
	It's our destiny (this is our destiny)
	Quit playing games with me (quit playing games with me)
	Play me like I'm your Nintendo
	Break me like bricks through the window
	Slay me with your innuendos
	Chase me then drift where the wind blows
	Where the wind blows
	Oh, you could be my little Princess Peach
	And I could be your Super Mario
	The two of us were always meant to be
	I know I never shoulda let you go (I know I never shoulda let you go)
	And now you're almost always out of reach
	I can't take the distance in between you and me

	No matter what, it turns out the same
	You're up in a castle, I'm down in the drain
	You're on a whole other level of love
	I'm stuck at the bottom, you're way up above
	So many enemies in between us
	But you know I'll never give up
	Oh, you could be my little Princess Peach
	And I could be your Super Mario
	The two of us were always meant to be
	I know I never shoulda let you go
	And now you're almost always out of reach
	I can't take the distance in between you and me
	It's our destiny (this is our destiny)
	Quit playing games with me (quit playing games with me)
	Play me like I'm your Nintendo
	Break me like bricks through the window
	Slay me with your innuendos
	Chase me then drift where the wind blows
	Where the wind blows
	Oh, you could be my little Princess Peach
	And I could be your Super Mario
	The two of us were always meant to be
	I know I never shoulda let you go (I know I never shoulda let you go)

	I know I never shoulda let you go
	I've been waiting for a lifetime
	You've been waiting for the right time
	If I had an extra life
	I swear I would die for you twice
	I turn off the power and take out the game
	Blow on the cartridge and try it again
